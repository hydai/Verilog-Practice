Part A.
    Please cd in hw1_A. 
    If you want to run the simulation, using "make".
    If you want to run code checking, using "make check".
    After finishing the simulation, you can use "make clean"
    to clean temp files or "make vclean" to clean debug files.

Part B.
    Please cd in hw1_B.
    If you want to run the simulation of testcase of B,
    using "make".
    If you want to run code checking, using "make check".
    If you want to run the simulation of testcase of A,
    using "make testcaseA".
    After finishing the simulation, you can use "make clean"
    to clean temp files or "make vclean" to clean debug files.
